# XML Comparison Tool

## Overview
This tool automatically compares XML responses from two environments for the same request. Obtain the XML responses, then use comparison tools to highlight differences, additions, or deletions for a detailed analysis.

## Guidelines

1. Clone this repository

2. Go to src/test/java/regression.xml and run it.

3. Or, go to class file - src/test/java/regression.xml and run tests individually.

4. To view comparison results, go to - testreport/extent_report.html. 

5. For security purposes, we are not sending requests to external systems. This POC uses saved responses for the demo of the comparison tool and concept. Simply, send the request and collect responses as String REQ1 and REQ2 for live comparison.

6. Update files - request1.xml, request2.xml and request3.xml to perform new comparisons locally.
